          <p>
            Before I got into software development, I was excited about many
            things around a computer in my high school, from hardware to
            software. Remember the days when forum was still popular? That was
            when I liked fiddling around with XAMPP and vBulletin and similar
            forum software. I even wrote{" "}
            <Link href="https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page" target="_blank">
              NSIS
            </Link>{" "}
            scripts to create alternative update installers for{" "}

              Audition Online
            </Link>, my favourite game at the time, which were less in size
            compared to the one from the publisher thanks to delta patching.
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to pursue Software Engineering in university afterward. I
            thought I would go with PHP but I ended up going with the Microsoft
            stack where I would work with C# and .NET Framework because those
            were what I was most familiar with after graduation.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I began my career as a full-stack engineer by joining a fresher
            program in 2015. That was my first time to work on a real world
            project in a team of many newly graduated engineers. I worked mostly
            with ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework and jQuery. Those software
            development life cycle, software development principles and
            practices were all new to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            After quite some time, I became interested in the JavaScript
            ecosystem and started with AngularJS and Node.js. But it didn't last
            long as I couldn't resist new technologies. I decided to learn React
            and started my new journey as a front end engineer. I had the
            opportunity to work with other exciting technologies - TypeScript,
            Next.js, GraphQL, gRPC, Cypress, Playwright, just to name a few.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now let's leave those programming things aside. I am not such a
            nerdy techie who is all into technologies. I am an ordinary person
            and have hobbies just like everyone else. To entertain myself, I
            usually listen to music, watch movies and hang out with friends. I
            would go around the city to explore coffee shops and cocktail bars
            when I need to calm my mind. I may take photos during the time since
            I have an interest in phone photography. I own a Nokia 808 PureView,
            a Pixel 4 XL and an iPhone 14 Pro Max currently but I mostly use the
            Pixel since it has a great modded camera app that allows me to tune
            various photo capturing settings such as noise reduction strength,
            saturation and sharpness. You can see my photos on{" "}

            Ah. Let me introduce this little family member to you. His name is
            Sữa (Milk). I adopted him in December 2018 when he was over three
            months old.
